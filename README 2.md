# CheapEats

Welcome to ZIPcount! The quick and easy discount finder for food around Madrid! Students spend too much on overpriced food delivery only because it's convenient. We will make eating cheap more convenient. Our program is simple. Enter a postal code and the type of food you want. We will return with a list of restaurants with promotions, as well as a map-view to make it easier for you.
